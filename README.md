# Insha-assignemnt-1

We were given the following data:
exam_data = {'name': ['Anastasia', 'Dima', 'Katherine', 'James', 'Emily', 'Michael', 'Matthew', 'Laura', 'Kevin', 'Jonas'],
'score': [12.5, 9, 16.5, np.nan, 9, 20, 14.5, np.nan, 8, 19],
'attempts': [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1],
'qualify': ['yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes']}
labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']



and were asked to perform the following questions 
Write a Pandas program to select the rows where number of attempts in the examination is less than 2 and score greater than 15.

Write a Pandas program to change the score in row 'd' to 11.5

Write a Pandas program to calculate the sum of the examination attempts by the students.

Write a Pandas program to calculate the mean score for each different student in DataFrame.

Write a Pandas program to append a new row 'k' to data frame with given values for each column. Now delete the new row and return the original DataFrame

Write a Pandas program to sort the DataFrame first by 'name' in descending order, then by 'score' in ascending order.

Write a Pandas program to replace the 'qualify' column contains the values 'yes' and 'no' with True and False

Write a Pandas program to change the name 'James' to 'Suresh' in name column of the DataFrame.

Write a Pandas program to delete the 'attempts' column from the DataFrame.

Write a Pandas program to insert a new column in existing DataFrame.

Write a Pandas program to iterate over rows in a DataFrame.

Write a Pandas program to count the NaN values in one or more columns in DataFrame.
